<summary>Introduction</summary>
<br/>

Thank you for attending this Predictive Decisioning demonstration.
Today I’ll show you how IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation uses machine learning to enhance Retention offers. You will learn how to integrate Watson Studio Machine Learning with the Cloud Pak to create prediction services. These predictions are then used by automated decision services to target retention policies, lower customer retention costs, and eliminate many paper-based processes.<br/><br/>

We will see how business users can quickly get started creating and using predictions to improve their everyday processes. Data scientists will also learn ways to speed experimentation in AI development.<br/><br/>

Let’s get started!<br/>
