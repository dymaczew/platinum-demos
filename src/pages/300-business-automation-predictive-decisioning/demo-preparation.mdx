| DEMO OVERVIEW | |
| :---         | :--- |
| **Scenario overview** | This demo shows the integration of prediction services inside rules-based decisions and how Cloud Pak for Business Automation leverages intelligent decisions to deliver rapidly new applications. This scenario is not willing to explain in detail what rules are, and it is not in the scope of the scenario to go deep inside Automation Decision Services's rule management capabilities. The focus of the demo is really around the artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) native integration. It is also in the scope of this demo to show the power of Cloud Pak for Business Automation to create low-code interfaces from where Automation Decision Services will be consumed and valorized. <br/><br/> This demo is 100% based on IBM technology: <br/> 1.	Watson Machine Learning <br/> 2.	Cloud Pak for Business Automation |
| **Demo products** | Cloud Pak for Business Automation V21.0.1, Cloud Pak for Data and AI |
| **Demo capabilities** | Business Rule Automation, Predictive Services Integration, Rapid Application Development |
| **Demo guidance** | This demo script has multiple tasks, that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see (**Screenshots**). This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content. If it seems difficult for you to execute, the customer will focus on your delivery. |

<summary>4 - Deploy your ML models</summary>
<br/>

Your ML services will be accessible to other applications once deployed. <br/>
NOTE: Your free quota will be consumed as soon as the service will de deployed. Don't forget to remove the deployments as soon as you are done with your demonstration. Follow the **Un-deploy your ML models** step to un-deploy the services and to stop the billing process.

1. From your Watson Studio environment, go in your deployment space
2. In the **Asset** tab, deploy the two assets by clicking on the rocket button
![](./images/image51.png) <br/>
3. Select **Online** and name your deployment **Churn** (Resp **Lifetime value**) for the two deployments. Click on **Create** for each of them.
