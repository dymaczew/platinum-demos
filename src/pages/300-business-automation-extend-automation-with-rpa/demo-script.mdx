Process Portal is highly customizable to fit your organization’s look and feel. The responsive user interface provides flexibility to get work done anywhere, at any time, on any device type, from a desktop device in the office to a mobile device at home or at a customer site. It can be tailored through a set of configuration options without having to customize the Process Portal application itself. <br/><br/>

To request a quote, a customer service representative initiates a new quote request and enters the customer’s policy data.
