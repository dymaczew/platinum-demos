| DEMO OVERVIEW | |

| **Demo capabilities** | Workflow, Robotic Process Automation |
| **Demo guidance** | This demo script has multiple tasks, that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**) and what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**). It also includes diagrams and screenshots you will see. This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content.

<details>

<summary>* Important note for each time you restart the RPA VM</summary>

<br/>

The RPA license will need to be reactivated each time the RPA VM restarts (due to a specific networking issue in the hosting environment). <br/><br/>
1. The first time you launch RPA Studio after a restart, you will be prompted to activate the license.<br/><br/> ![](./images/Reactivate-RPA1.png) <br/><br/>

2. Enter the license information (provided to you by your RPA SaaS administrator). <br/><br/>

3. Relaunch RPA Studio

<br/>

**Note**: When opening RPA Studio, it may report the error below (this is a known issue). You can simply dismiss the error. There do not seem to be any additional problems with the demo. <br/><br/>
