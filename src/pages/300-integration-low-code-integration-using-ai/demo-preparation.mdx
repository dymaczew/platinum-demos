| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Scenario overview** | In this demo you will synchronize data between Salesforce and Insightly cloud CRM. Prior to the demo you need to have access to both services and create endpoints to access securely during the demo. <br/><br/> Salesforce and Insightly are SaaS-hosted CRM systems, i.e. they are hosted in the cloud. In this scenario, we will synchronize contact information data between both solutions.  |
| **Demo products** | Cloud Pak for Integration V2021.2.1 |
| **Demo capabilities** | Application Integration, API Management |
| **Demo guidance** | This demo script has multiple tasks, that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see (**Screenshots**).<br/><br/>This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content. If it seems difficult for you to execute, the customer will focus on your delivery. |

<br/>

![endpoint-salesforce-connect](./images/endpoint-salesforce-connect.png)

<br/>

5. Here you need to enter your Salesforce credentials. Insert the login URL into the connector account form as shown below. **IMPORTANT**: You **MUST** enter the **‘https://’** part as well – it won’t work if you just copy/paste from the Salesforce screen.

<br/>

![endpoint-salesforce-login-details](./images/endpoint-salesforce-login-details.png)

<br/>

6. To populate the Password field on the connector account screen you will need to concatenate the Password used to log into the Salesforce account with the Security Token received via email. For example if your Salesforce password is ‘myGreatPassword’ and your Salesforce security token is ‘2325jsdhew4312hs534dh’ then you should enter ‘myGreatPassword2325jsdhew4312hs534dh’ in the password field.

<br/>
