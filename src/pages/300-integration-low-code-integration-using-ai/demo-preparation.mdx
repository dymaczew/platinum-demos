| DEMO OVERVIEW |                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Scenario overview** | In this demo you are going to synchronize data between Salesforce and Insightly cloud CRM. You need to have these services and endpoints created and all the credentials necessary to access them securely in the demo. <br/><br/> Both Salesforce and Insightly are CRM systems provided as a SaaS (i.e., they are hosted in the cloud). In this scenario, we will synchronize contact information data between both solutions.  |
| **Demo products** | Cloud Pak for Integration V2021.2.1 |
| **Demo capabilities** | Application Integration, Artificial Intelligence |
| **Demo guidance** | A complete demo script is on the second tab above. You can download a printer-ready PDF of the demo script <a href="./AI-powered-low-code-integration.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. <br/><br/> This demo script has multiple tasks that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see (**Screenshots**).<br/><br/>This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based in your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content. If it seems difficult for you to execute, the customer will focus on your delivery. |

<summary>4 - Connect Cloud Pak for Integration to your endpoints</summary>
<br/>

Let’s configure our services endpoints in Cloud Pak for Integration.

<br/>

1. Open your **Cloud Pak for Integration Home page**. In the Integrations area, click on **ace-designer-demo**.

<br/>

![endpoint-home](./images/endpoint-home.png)

<br/>

2. Open the **Catalog**.

<br/>

![endpoint-catalog](./images/endpoint-catalog.png)

<br/>

3. Here you can see a list of the available connectors.

<br/>

![endpoint-connectors](./images/endpoint-connectors.png)

<br/>

4. Search for **Salesforce** and click **Connect**.

<br/>

![endpoint-salesforce-connect](./images/endpoint-salesforce-connect.png)

<br/>

5. Enter your Salesforce credentials here. Insert the login URL into the connector account form as shown below. **IMPORTANT**: You **MUST** enter the **‘https://’** part as well – it won’t work if you just copy/paste from the Salesforce screen.

<br/>

![endpoint-salesforce-login-details](./images/endpoint-salesforce-login-details.png)

<br/>

6. To populate the Password field on the connector account screen, you will need to concatenate the Password used to log into the Salesforce account with the Security Token received via email. For example, if your Salesforce password is ‘myGreatPassword’ and your Salesforce security token is ‘2325jsdhew4312hs534dh’ then you should enter ‘myGreatPassword2325jsdhew4312hs534dh’ in the password field.

<br/>

![endpoint-salesforce-login-details2](./images/endpoint-salesforce-login-details2.png)

<br/>

7. As needed in the connector account UI as follows, use Salesforce’s Consumer Key and Secret as **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, respectively. Click **Connect**.

<br/>

![endpoint-salesforce-login-details3](./images/endpoint-salesforce-login-details3.png)

<br/>

8. Now search for **Insightly** and click **Connect**.
